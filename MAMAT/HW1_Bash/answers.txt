Question 1:
This task would have taken us atleast a few hours.

Question 2:
It's a lot more efficient to use scripts for sorting and orginazing large amounts 
of unprocessed data . In addition , scripts also can be used for prediction 
algorithms (the database which we get is friendly for work and the data is easy
for extraction), tests for code and simulations etc.

Question 3:
In order to run the script every hour we would add time - based loop which will
run the algorithm every hour since the initial run  (it requres only one
manual run and then it runs automatically) . In order to not multiply current 
players we can add to the algorithm a condition in which only if the player didnt
appear in the most recent list until now he will be added.
